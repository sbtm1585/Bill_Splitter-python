<p></p><p>We have a dictionary called <code class="language-python">student_list</code> that represents the enrollment of students in various subjects at a small school. In this dictionary, the keys are subject names, and the values are lists of students taking each subject.</p><p>Your task is to print the name of the most popular subject. The most popular subject is the one with the highest number of enrolled students.</p><p>For example, given the following <code class="language-python">student_list</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-python">student_list = {
    "English": ['Tim', 'Carl', 'Dean', 'Jane'],
    "Maths": ['Jane', 'Mike', 'Ann', 'Kate', 'Nick', 'Jenny'],
    "Chemistry": ['Tim', 'Carl', 'Dean']
}</code></pre><p>Your program should output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">Maths</code></pre><p>since Maths has the highest number of students (6) compared to the other subjects. Note that this is a synthetic example and your code will be tested with a different <code class="language-python">student_list</code>.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
