<p>Sometimes it happens that we lack data and need to make up a bunch of new examples rather quickly. Of course, you can spend some time writing those examples yourself, but it's not so efficient, right? It would make more sense to shift the responsibility to your computer, namely, the Python's built-in module <strong>random</strong>. In this module, a random search is used to generate elements and is performed using an algorithm whose starting point is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15487" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a seed refers to the starting point of the random number generation algorithm in the built-in `random` module. | The seed determines the sequence of pseudo-random numbers produced by the module. By setting a specific seed value, you can reproduce the same sequence of numbers, making it useful for testing and debugging. If you don't set the seed, the module uses a default starting point based on the current system time, generating a different sequence each time the program runs."><strong>seed</strong></a>. The seed allows us to save the current state, making it easy to reproduce the same numbers on several code executions. Therefore, the results given aren't random at all and, technically, this module should have been called <strong>pseudo-random</strong>. Nevertheless, it may be useful for a large number of applications, such as modeling and simulation.</p><h5 id="random-method-first-steps">Random method: first steps</h5><p>First of all, we need to import the module:</p><pre><code class="language-python">import random</code></pre><p>After we've managed to do the previous task, it's possible to try the <code class="language-python">random.random()</code> function that will provide us with a pseudo-random number from 0 to 1:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(random.random())  # 0.5557276751294531</code></pre><p>We can also control the pseudo-random behavior by specifying the seed manually, i.e. configure the new sequence of pseudo-random numbers using the <code class="language-python">random.seed(x)</code> function. You can set your own number or omit the optional argument x and consequently current system time would be used by default.</p><pre><code class="language-python">random.seed()

If you choose 5, you'll get 0.6229016948897019 as a result, if 20 – 0.9056396761745207, etc. Thus, the seed controls the behavior of pseudo-random in Python and can be used with any other function of the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6019" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, the `random` module is a built-in module that provides functions to generate pseudo-random numbers. | It uses an algorithm with a starting point called a seed to generate these numbers.
