<p>Anthony keeps track of what he eats: he writes down how many calories are in his meals. Use the list of dictionaries to calculate the total amount of calories per day and print it.</p>
<p>The sample input will look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">meals = [
        {"title": "Oatmeal pancakes with apple and cinnamon", "kcal": 370},
        {"title": "Italian salad with fusilli and ham", "kcal": 320},
        {"title": "Bulgur with vegetables", "kcal": 350},
        {"title": "Curd souffle with lingonberries and ginger", "kcal": 225},
        {"title": "Oatmeal with honey and peanuts", "kcal": 440}]</code></pre>
<p>The output in this case should be <code class="language-python">1705</code>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> We hope you will use the pair <code class="language-python">"kcal" : value</code>.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
